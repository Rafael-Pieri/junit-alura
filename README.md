## Alura Online Courses - Tests: TDD using Java

### Overview
Repository with some examples of how to implement unit tests with jUnit using the TDD methodology.

#### jUnit
JUnit is an open-source framework, similar to Java software testing, created by Erich Gamma and Kent Beck, 
supporting the creation of automated tests in the Java programming language.

#### Test Driven Development (TDD)
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: 
requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. 
This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements.
